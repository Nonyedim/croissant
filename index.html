    <p>
      Croissants have long been associated with Parisian bakeries, but that’s
      not where they originated. Shocking, we know! These delicious pastries are
      said to have been invented in Vienna, Austria. The tale goes that a baker
      created the crescent-shaped bread to celebrate the defeat of the Ottoman
      Empire, mirroring the crescent moon on the Turkish flag. Legend says that
      it was then Queen Marie-Antoinette -- who was born in Vienna -- to
      introduce them to France. The royal so missed the Austrian treat that she
      requested that French bakers make croissants just for her.
